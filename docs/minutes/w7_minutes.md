## Agenda Items

### Opening by Chairperson

_Good atmosphere_

### Approval of the agenda

Everybody agrees with the agenda

### Stand-up

- Showed demo.
- Work from last Week:
    - Andrei: Number of player in the waiting room at one time, enhanced point system
    - Anna : Emoji - Frontend, 2 Jokers - Backend
    - Anthony : Bug - Endscreen, Testing - commons
    - Kazek: Images - sending from backend to frontend, white background, Bugs
    - Lucia: Bugs, Help Screen, commons testing
    - Santiago: Intermediate Leaderboard, Bug Fixing
- In Progress: Reactions, Jokers, Should-haves, starting on Could-haves
- We want to close the majority of Should-haves this week

### TA Initial Points

- Gitlab: Visible improvement, milestones are set, a few issues don't have people assigned to them - should be done by
  the end of the project
- Distribution of tasks itself: Not really going too well - has to be improved.
- Weights: Issues that have been completed or are in progress have weights assigned, make sure all the issues have
  weights.
- Sprint planning: Milestones are set, finalise across all the previous weeks, nice improvement, move tasks across
  sprints if they're not finished.
- GitInspector: Kazek does too much (at least by lines of code). Lines of code are affected especially by flawed fxml
  diffs, so measuring by that is somewhat flawed. Everyone should aim to have 1000 lines of code by the end of the
  project.

- Close all must-haves as soon as possible
- Deadline for should-haves - this week

- Commit messages have improved.
- Merge requests shouldn't have 500 lines of code
- Merging to main goes well
- Documentation got better, however some public methods are still missing comments

- Testing started, finish testing the server, lacking knowledge to properly test client
- All api classes must be fully tested

- We should keep merging frequently to development

- Lucia - work more on backend
- Anthony and Lucia - More lines of code, more merge requests

- For MRs:
    - Good amount of comments: Kazek, Andrei, Lucia, Anna, Santiago
    - Low amount of comments: Anthony

- Pipeline - still yellow, but it keeps improving
- Make sure you don't miss the Teamwork Assignment

- Overall: On track
-

- **Take-away: Set deadlines, actually keep working!**

### Tips & Tops

#### Tips

- Communication can be improved - send your design decisions in the groupchat
- Check MR on GitLab in a fixed interval, so we don't leave them hanging
- More merge requests
- Go through the closed merge requests from that week, before merging to main so everyone understands what is going on.
- Better task division

#### Tops

- Gitlab represents our work more accurately, the boards are organised, milestones and weights were added
- More active on Gitlab, better code reviews
- Smooth workflow
- Making steady progress

## Closing

- Next chairman is Kazek, next secretary is Anthony.
