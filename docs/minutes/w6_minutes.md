## Agenda Items

### Opening by Chairperson

_No minutes._

### Approval of the agenda

Everybody agrees with the agenda

### TA Initial Points

- Pointing part: not great, not terrible
- Distribution of tasks itself: Not really going too well.
- Weights: It would be nice, just one metric and call it a day.
- Sprint planning: We should include milestones (we forgot on week 5).
- GitInspector: Kazek does too much (at least by lines of code). Lines of code are affected especially by flawed fxml
  diffs, so measuring by that is somewhat flawed

- We should set a deadline for must-haves for this week.
- We should also set a deadline for should-haves.
- We could set a deadline for user stories, period.

- Code is good, the documentation is not too great.
    - Server side has good documentation.
    - Client side has bad documentation.

- We should also start testing.

- We should keep merging frequently to development.

- Maybe have more code reviews?

- For MRs:
    - Good amount of comments: Kazek, Andrei, Lucia, Anna
    - Low amount of comments: Anthony, Santiago

- Overall: OK

- **Take-away: Set deadlines, actually keep working!**

### Stand-up

- Showed demo.
- Are we happy with the distribution of tasks?
    - We have run into trouble with work being more than expected.
    - We have also often agreed to both do what ends up being the same work.
    - **Solution**: Think about dependencies of each task identify overlaps.

- **Think about deadlines for should-haves for next week?**

- Next chairman is Andrei, next secretary is Lucia.

- Keep up with the definition of done, **also in tasks**, not just user-stories, etc.

### Tips & Tops

#### Tips

- Communication can be improved
- Communication can be improved, especially on MRs, be more active.
- Communication can be improved, do not ignore comments on MRs & approve them
- We need to look more into what is a test, and actually testing.

#### Tops

- We're also doing well, we achieved a good demo.
- We are doing pretty good compared to other groups.
- Communication is good.
